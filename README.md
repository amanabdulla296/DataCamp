In this folder I will share my projects which I have completed during my Data Scientist with Python career track on Datacamp (https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python). 
Projects allowed me to practice and apply the skills I have learned in the DataCamp courses. 
In each project, I have carried out an end-to-end analysis, on a real-world task, using real-world tools and workflows.
