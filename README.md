# Real-world problems using DataCamp

**In this folder I share my projects which I have successfully completed during my [Data Scientist with Python career track on Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/data-scientist-with-python). Projects allowed me to practice and apply the skills I have learned in the DataCamp courses. In each project, I have carried out an end-to-end analysis, on a real-world task, using real-world tools and workflows.**
