# Project Description


In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery: he discovers handwashing. Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives. However, at that time his discovery was not welcomed by his fellows. In this we will analyze his data and visualize the results. Then we will explain why his discovery was not welcomed by his fellows.
